#Introduce a SiegeEngine Unit.

########
#Part 1#
########

#SiegeEngine will require lumber when built by a Barracks. 
#Besides food and gold, Barracks therefore also need to have a lumber resource.

#A Barracks starts off with 500 lumber.

########
#Part 2#
########

#The SiegeEngine is very effective against buildings such as the Barracks. 
#However, it is ineffective against other Units. (It can't attack them, as if they were dead.)

#So unlike with Footman (whose attacks do a fraction of the damage they normally would), 
#a SiegeEngine does 2Ã— damage against a Barracks.

#Also, SiegeEngine can attack other SiegeEngine even though they cannot attack any other Units 
#(such as Peasants or Footmans.)

#SiegeEngine are initialized with the following stats.
#AP: 50
#HP: 400
#Cost: 200 gold, 60 lumber, 3 food
#Make note, you will need to require the siege_engine.rb file in spec_helper.rb.
